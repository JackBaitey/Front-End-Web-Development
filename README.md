## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   ├── robots.txt
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Tour.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                        |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `npm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |

## Front End Website Project - Why did I use Astro?

I wanted to find a developemnt platform that was easy to use and could compile a website together using Node. I chose Astro as it was one of the easier solutions that I found that made the whole source code for websites organised and well put together for working as a team. This is due to the components and layouts folders in the source code that make it possible for editing certain aspects of tehe website without interfering in other people's work.

## Front End Website Project - What changes have I made?

Upon entering the development framework of Astro, I began to change some things that had been given to me. This included removing certain pages, stylesheets etc.. that simply cluttered up the file structure. By cleaning up the file structure I give myself an easy to work with environment to add my own content to.
